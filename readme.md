This is a talk I gave at the OkcJs in March about Phaser.js


You can see the live slideshow/demos [here](http://the-simian.github.io/okcjs_march_presentation/)

Many of the working examples in the talk come from the [phaser site examples.](http://phaser.io/)



#Run this!

You can download and run this yourself, if you want. Just clone my repo and `npm install`. Afterwards nodemon server.js.
